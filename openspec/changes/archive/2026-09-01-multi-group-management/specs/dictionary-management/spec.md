## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dictionary groups
The system SHALL let the user organize loaded dictionaries into multiple named groups, each an ordered subset, and SHALL let the user select which group is active for lookups. An implicit "All" group containing every loaded dictionary is always available. Managing groups, their membership, and their order is part of this capability.

#### Scenario: All loaded dictionaries are the default group
- **WHEN** the user first loads dictionaries without creating any group
- **THEN** lookups use an implicit "All" group containing every loaded dictionary

#### Scenario: Create a group
- **WHEN** the user creates a named group and adds some dictionaries to it
- **THEN** the group appears in the groups list with that membership

#### Scenario: Select the active group
- **WHEN** the user picks a group as active
- **THEN** subsequent lookups use only that group's dictionaries, in that group's order

#### Scenario: Reorder dictionaries within a group
- **WHEN** the user changes the order of dictionaries inside a group
- **THEN** the combined article for that group respects the new order

#### Scenario: Delete a group
- **WHEN** the user deletes a group
- **THEN** the group no longer appears in the list, and lookups fall back to the "All" group (or the next active group), without error

#### Scenario: Delete a group that is active
- **WHEN** the user deletes the currently active group
- **THEN** the app falls back to the "All" group so lookups keep working
